      **Note:**
        - This field is valid only if the `applyCredit` field is set to `true`.
        - If no value is specified for this field, the default priority order is used, ["CreditMemo", "UnappliedPayment"], to apply credit memos first and then apply unapplied payments.
        - If only one item is specified, only the items of the spedified type are applied to invoices. For example, if the value is `["CreditMemo"]`, only credit memos are used to apply the debit memo.

          If no gateway ID is specified in the request body, the default gateway
          for the customer account is used automatically, if this default one is
          not configured, the default gateway of the tenant would be used.

          If no payment method ID is specified in the request body, the default
          payment method for the customer account is used automatically. If the
          default payment method is different from the type of payments that you
          want to create, an error occurs.
