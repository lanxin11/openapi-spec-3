        description: >
          The date when the amendment changes take effect. The format of the
          date is yyyy-mm-dd.


          If there is already a future-dated Update Product amendment on the
          subscription, the `specificUpdateDate` field will be used instead of
          this field to specify when the Update Product amendment takes effect.

      customerAcceptanceDate:
        description: >
          The date when the customer accepts the contract in yyyy-mm-dd format.


          If this field is not set:


          * If the `serviceActivationDate` field is not set, the value of this
          field is set to be the contract effective date.

          * If the `serviceActivationDate` field is set, the value of this field
          is set to be the service activation date.


          The billing trigger dates must follow this rule:


          contractEffectiveDate <= serviceActivationDate <=
          contractAcceptanceDate

          You must specify a Service Activation date if the Customer Acceptance
          date is set. If the Customer Acceptance date is not set, the value of
          the `serviceActivationDate` field defaults to be the Contract
          Effective Date.


          The billing trigger dates must follow this rule:


          contractEffectiveDate <= serviceActivationDate <=
          contractAcceptanceDate
