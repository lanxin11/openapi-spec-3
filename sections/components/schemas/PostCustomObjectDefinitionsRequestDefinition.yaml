            Only the `manyToOne` cardinality can be used when creating
            relationships.  A relationship with `oneToMany` cardinality is
            created implicitly when a `manyToOne` relationship is created.


            A custom object definition can have a maximum of 2 `manyToOne`
            relationships.

                    Specifies whether Zuora validates the values of mapped
                    fields

                    in custom object records.


                    By default, Zuora validates the values of mapped fields

                    in custom object records. For example, if the

                    custom object definition has a field called `AccountId__c`

                    that is mapped to the `Id` field of the `account` object,

                    Zuora verifies that the value of `AccountId__c` is a valid

                    account ID when a custom object record is created.

                    If the value of `AccountId__c` is not a valid account ID,

                    the operation fails.
