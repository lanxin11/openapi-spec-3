      Transaction type. Invoice Adjustment is deprecated on Production. Zuora
      recommends that you use the Invoice Item Adjustment instead.


      If you enable the Invoice Settlement feature, Debit Memo Item, Credit Memo
      Item, and Credit Memo Application Item are available, Payment and Refund
      will be replaced by Payment Application and Refund Application. 


      If you enable both the Invoice Settlement feature and the Invoice Item
      Settlement feature, Payment and Refund will be replaced by Payment
      Application Item and Refund Application Item.
