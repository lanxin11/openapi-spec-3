      and the `ServiceActivation` field is not set for a `CreateSubscription`
      order action, a `Pending` order and a `Pending Activation` subscription
      are created.

      and the `CustomerAcceptance` field is not set for a `CreateSubscription`
      order action, a `Pending` order and a `Pending Acceptance` subscription
      are created. At the same time, if the service activation date field is
      also required and not set, a `Pending` order and a `Pending Activation`
      subscription are created instead.

      Unless the type of order action is `RenewSubscription`, you must use the
      corresponding field to provide information about the order action. For
      example, if the type of order action is `AddProduct`, you must set the
      `addProduct` field.


      Zuora returns an error if you set a field that corresponds to a different
      type of order action. For example, if the type of order action is
      `AddProduct`, Zuora returns an error if you set the `updateProduct` field.


      A [pending
      order](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/Pending_Order_and_Subscription)
      supports the following order actions:
       * CreateSubscription
       * AddProduct
       * UpdateProduct
       * RemoveProduct
       * RenewSubscription
       * TermsAndConditions

      However, pending orders created through all order actions except for
      "Create new subscription":
       * Do not impact the subscription status.
       * Are in **Limited Availability**. If you want to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com). 

      A pending order is created in either of the following conditions:
       * [Zuora is configured to require service activation](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Billing_Settings/Define_Default_Subscription_Settings#Require_Service_Activation_of_Orders.3F) and the service activation date is not set in your "Create an order" call.
       * [Zuora is configured to require customer acceptance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Billing_Settings/Define_Default_Subscription_Settings#Require_Customer_Acceptance_of_Orders.3F) and the customer acceptance date is not set in your "Create an order" call.
       * When a charge in the subscription has its `triggerEvent` field set as `SpecificDate` and the `specificTriggerDate` field is not set in your "Create an order" API call.
