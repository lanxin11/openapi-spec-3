      productRatePlans:
        description: >
          URL to retrieve information about all product rate plans of a specific
          product. For example,
          `/v1/rateplan/40289f466463d683016463ef8b7301a0/productRatePlan`. If
          you want to view the product rate plan details, call [List all product
          rate plans of a
          product](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_ProductRatePlans)
          with the returned URL.


          This field is in Zuora REST API version control. If you set the
          `zuora-version` request header to `230.0` or later, the value of this
          field is a URL. Zuora recommends that you use the latest behavior to
          retrieve product information.


          If you do not set the `zuora-version` request header or you set this
          header to `229.0` or earlier, the value of this field is an array of
          product rate plan details. For more information about the array, see
          the response body of [List all product rate plans of a
          product](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_ProductRatePlans).
          **Note**: The array contains a maximum of 300 product rate plans.
          Additionally, across all product rate plans, at most 300 product rate
          plan charges are returned.
