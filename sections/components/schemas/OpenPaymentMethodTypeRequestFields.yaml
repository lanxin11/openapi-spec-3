  checksum:
    description: >
      The checksum value of a payment method is used to identify if this payment
      method is the same as another one, or if this payment method is altered to
      another new payment method.


      Set this flag to `true` for the following scenarios:
        - The field should be part of checksum calculation.
        - The field is a critical differentiator for this type. 

          
      For example, if you select the credit card number and expiration date as
      the checksum fields for the CreditCard payment method type, when you
      modified the expiration date, Zuora considers this payment method as a
      different payment method compared to the original one.


      This field cannot be `null` or empty.


      This field cannot be updated after the creation of the custom payment
      method type.
    type: boolean
  defaultValue:
    description: >
      The default value of the field. `null` is supported.


      If a required field is added after the custom payment method type is
      published, `defaultValue` is required.

  editable:
    description: >
      Specify `true` if this field can be updated through PUT API or UI.


      This field cannot be `null` or empty.


      Note: If `editable` is set to `false`, you can specify the value of this
      field in the UI and POST API when creating a payment method. However,
      after you created the payment method, you cannot edit this field through
      PUT API or UI.

  label:
    description: |
      The label that is used to refer to this field in the Zuora UI.

      An alphanumeric string, excluding JSON preserved characters e.g.  * \ ’ ”

      This field cannot be `null` or empty or any reserved field name.
    maxLength: 30
    type: string
  maxLength:
    description: >
      A maximum length limitation of the field value. The specified value must
      be in the range of [1,8000]. `maxLength` must be greater than or equal to
      `minLength`.


      After the custom payment method type is created, you can only increase the
      value of `maxLength`. Decreasing the value is not supported.
    type: integer
  minLength:
    description: >
      A minimal length limitation of the field value.
          
      0 <= `minLength` <= `maxLength`


      The value of this metadata does not determine whether the field is a
      required field. It only defines the minimal length of the field value.


      After the custom payment method type is created, you can only decrease the
      value of `minLength`. Increasing the value is not supported.
    type: integer
  name:
    description: >
      The API name of this field. It must be uinique.


      An alphanumeric string starting with a capital letter, excluding JSON
      preserved characters e.g.  * \ ’ ”


      Though this field must be defined with a string starting with a capital
      letter, use this string with the first letter in lowercase when you
      specify it in other API operations. For example, `AmazonPayToken` is the
      defined value for `name`. In the request of the "Create a payment method"
      API operation, use `amazonPayToken`.


      This field cannot be `null` or empty or any reserved field name.

    description: >
      This flag determines whether this field will be used for identifying this
      payment method in the Zuora UI. The field will be shown in the Payment
      Method field in the UI.


      This field cannot be `null` or empty.


      Notes:
        - In one custom payment method type, set `representer` to `true` for at least one field .
        - In one custom payment method type, you can set `representer` to `true` for multiple fields.

  type:
    description: >
      The type of this field.


      For the `date` type, ISO_LOCAL_DATE format is supported, such as
      `2011-12-03`. The timezone is not expected for the `date` type. For
      example, `2011-12-03+01:00` will be rejected.


      For the `datetime` type, only ISO_OFFSET_DATE_TIME format is supported,
      such as `2011-12-03T10:15:30+01:00`. Timezone must be included. A string
      like `2011-12-03T10:15:30` or `2011-12-03T10:15:30+01:00[Europe/Paris]`
      will be rejected.


      If you need to define a `date` type with timezone or a `datetime` type
      without timezone, use the `string` type for now.


      This field cannot be `null` or empty.


      This field cannot be updated after the creation of the custom payment
      method type.

      Notes: 
        - If `visible` is set to `false`, you can still specify the value of this field in the UI and POST API when creating the payment method.
        - If `visible` is set to `false` and `editable` is set to `true`, this field is not accessible through GET API or UI for displaying details, but you can still see it and edit the value in the UI and PUT API when updating this payment method.
