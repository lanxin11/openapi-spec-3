      activation](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Billing_Settings/Define_Default_Subscription_Settings#Require_Service_Activation_of_Orders.3F)
      and the `ServiceActivation` field is not set for a `CreateSubscription`
      order action, a `Pending` order and a `Pending Activation` subscription
      are created.

      acceptance](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Billing_Settings/Define_Default_Subscription_Settings#Require_Customer_Acceptance_of_Orders.3F)

      order action, a `Pending` order and a `Pending Acceptance` subscription
      are created. At the same time, if the service activation date field is
      also required and not set, a `Pending` order and a `Pending Activation`
      subscription are created instead.
