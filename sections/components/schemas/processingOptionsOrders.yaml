  applicationOrder:
    description: >
      The priority order to apply credit memos and/or unapplied payments to an
      invoice. Possible item values are: `CreditMemo`, `UnappliedPayment`.


      **Note:**
        - This field is valid only if the `applyCredit` field is set to `true`.
        - If no value is specified for this field, the default priority order is used, ["CreditMemo", "UnappliedPayment"], to apply credit memos first and then apply unapplied payments.
        - If only one item is specified, only the items of the spedified type are applied to invoices. For example, if the value is `["CreditMemo"]`, only credit memos are used to apply to invoices.

      type: string
    type: array
  applyCredit:
    description: >
      Whether to automatically apply credit memos or unapplied payments, or both
      to an invoice.


      If the value is `true`, the credit memo or unapplied payment, or both will
      be automatically applied to the invoice. If no value is specified or the
      value is `false`, no action is taken.


      **Note:** This field is only available if you have [Invoice
      Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
      enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
      Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied
      Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want
      to enable Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and
      Checklist
