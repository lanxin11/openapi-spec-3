      SkipValidation:
        description: >-
          If you set this field to `false`, Zuora will send an authorization
          request to the payment gateway. If the authorization fails, the Create
          Payment Method request will fail as well. If the user knows that the
          card number or token is valid, we recommend disabling this feature
          because authorization requests to the card network incur additional
          processing fees. Currently, Zuora sends all authorizations as keyed
          entries.

          If you set this field to `true`, the authorization request is not
          sent.
