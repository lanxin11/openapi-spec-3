      GatewayOptionData:
        description: >
          A field used to pass gateway options. Zuora allows you to pass in
          special gateway-specific parameters for payments through the [gateway
          integrations that support gateway
          options](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/LA_Hosted_Payment_Pages/B_Payment_Pages_2.0/J_Client_Parameters_for_Payment_Pages_2.0#Gateway_Options).


          For each of these special parameters, you supply the name-value pair
          and Zuora passes it to the gateway. This allows you to add
          functionality that's supported by a specific gateway but currently not
          supported by Zuora.
