properties:
  specificTriggerDate:
    description: >
      Date in YYYY-MM-DD format. Only applicable if the value of the
      `triggerEvent` field is `SpecificDate`. 


      While this field is applicable, if this field is not set, your
      `CreateSubscription` order action creates a `Pending` order and a `Pending
      Acceptance` subscription. If at the same time the service activation date
      is required and not set, a `Pending Activation` subscription is created.


      While this field is applicable, if this field is not set, the following
      order actions create a `Pending` order but do not impact the subscription
      status. **Note**: This feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you want
      to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global
      Support](http://support.zuora.com/).

       * UpdateProduct
       * RemoveProduct
       * RenewSubscription
       * TermsAndConditions

      While this field is applicable, for the `updateProduct` order action, if
      the Pending order feature as above is not enabled, this field must not be
      set to null.
