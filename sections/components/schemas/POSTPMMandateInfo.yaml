    type: string
  mitProfileAction:
    description: >
      Specifies how Zuora activates the stored credential profile. Only
      applicable if you set the `status` field to `Active`.


      * `Activate` (default) - Use this value if you are creating the stored
      credential profile after receiving the customer's consent.

        Zuora will create the stored credential profile then send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. If the CIT succeeds, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Active`. If the CIT does not succeed, Zuora will not create a stored credential profile.
        
        If the payment gateway does not support the stored credential transaction framework, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Agreed`.


      * `Persist` - Use this value if the stored credential profile represents a
      stored credential profile in an external system. The status of the payment
      method's stored credential profile will be `Active`.
    enum:
      - Activate
      - Persist
