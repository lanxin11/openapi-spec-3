          Reference ID is used only in the custom unlimited rule to create a
          revenue schedule. In this scenario, the revenue schedule is not linked
          to an invoice item or invoice item adjustment.


          Use this field only when the revenue schedule is not linked to an
          invoice item or invoice item adjustment, such as for revenue schedules
          based on the Custom - Unlimited recognition model.
