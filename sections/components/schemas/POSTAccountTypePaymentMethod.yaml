  Container for information on payment methods to associate with this account.
  To associate a credit card payment method when creating an account, Zuora
  recommends that you use this field instead of the `creditCard` field.


  Note that you can not use this field together with `creditCard` or
  `hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId` to associate a payment method to an account.


  When creating a credit card payment method, it is recommended to enable [the
  support for stored credential
  transactions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/L_Payment_Methods/Stored_credential_transactions)
  for this payment method. Specify the [required
  fields](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/L_Payment_Methods/Stored_credential_transactions/Configuration_procedures/Create_a_new_payment_method)
  to enable the support.
