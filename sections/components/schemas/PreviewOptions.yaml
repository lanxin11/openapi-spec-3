      including: `cmrr`, `tcv`, `tcb`, and `tax`.

      * BillingDocs: `invoices` and `creditMemos` will be returned in the

      feature is enabled.

      Release 306, Zuora has upgraded the methodologies for calculating metrics
      in
      [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders).
      The new methodologies are reflected in the OrderDeltaMetrics. It is
      recommended that all customers use the [Order Delta
      Metrics](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Delta_Metrics/AA_Overview_of_Order_Delta_Metrics).
      If you are an existing [Order
      Metrics](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders/Key_Metrics_for_Orders)
      customer and want to migrate to Order Delta Metrics, submit a request at
      [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/). Whereas new customers,
      and existing customers not currently on [Order
      Metrics](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders/Key_Metrics_for_Orders),
      will no longer have access to Order Metrics, existing customers currently
      using Order Metrics will continue to be supported.

      * RampMetrics: ramp metrics will be returned in the response, including:
      `quantity`, `mrr`, `tcb`, `tcv` metrics for each charge and each ramp
      interval.

      * RampDeltaMetrics: ramp metrics changes will be returned in the response,
      including: `deltaQuantity`, `deltaMrr`, `deltaTcb`, `deltaTcv` metrics for
      each charge and each ramp interval.
