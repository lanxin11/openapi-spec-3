          options](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/LA_Hosted_Payment_Pages/B_Payment_Pages_2.0/J_Client_Parameters_for_Payment_Pages_2.0#Gateway_Options).


          For each of these special parameters, you supply the name-value pair
          and Zuora passes it to the gateway. This allows you to add
          functionality that's supported by a specific gateway but currently not
          supported by Zuora.

          Gateways check duplicates on the gateway order ID to ensure that the
          merchant do not accidentally enter the same transaction twice. This ID
          can also be used to do reconciliation and tie the payment to a natural
          key in external systems. The source of this ID varies by merchant.
          Some merchants use their shopping cart order IDs, and others use
          something different. Merchants use this ID to track transactions in
          their eCommerce systems.
