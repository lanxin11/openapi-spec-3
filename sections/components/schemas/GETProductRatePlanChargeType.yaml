      smoothingModel:
        description: >
          Specifies the smoothing model for an overage smoothing charge model or
          an tiered with overage model, which is an advanced type of a usage
          model that avoids spikes in usage charges. If a customer's usage
          spikes in a single period, then an overage smoothing model eases
          overage charges by considering usage and multiple periods.


          One of the following values shows which smoothing model will be
          applied to the charge when `Overage` or `Tiered with Overage` is used:


          - `RollingWindow` considers a number of periods to smooth usage. The
          rolling window starts and increments forward based on billing
          frequency. When allowed usage is met, then period resets and a new
          window begins.

          - `Rollover` considers a fixed number of periods before calculating
          usage. The net balance at the end of a period is unused usage, which
          is carried over to the next period's balance.
