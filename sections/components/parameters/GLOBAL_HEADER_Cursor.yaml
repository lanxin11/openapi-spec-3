  The cursor indicator of the data page you want to retrieve. By default, the
  first page of data is returned in the response. If more data pages are
  available, the operation returns `true` in the `hasMore` response body field.
  The `cursor` response body field specifies the cursor indicator of the next
  page of data. If there is no data after the current page, the value of
  `cursor` is `null`.
