  An entity ID. If you have [Zuora
  Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity)
  enabled and the OAuth token is valid for more than one entity, you must use
  this header to specify which entity to perform the operation in. If the OAuth
  token is only valid for a single entity, or you do not have Zuora Multi-entity
