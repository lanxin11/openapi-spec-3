    ## Access to the API


    If you have a Zuora tenant, you can access the Zuora REST API via one of the
    following endpoints:


    | Tenant              | Base URL for REST Endpoints |

    |-------------------------|-------------------------|

    |US Cloud 1 Production | https://rest.na.zuora.com  |

    |US Cloud 1 API Sandbox |  https://rest.sandbox.na.zuora.com |

    |US Cloud 2 Production | https://rest.zuora.com |

    |US Cloud 2 API Sandbox | https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com|

    |US Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.zuora.com |  

    |US Performance Test | https://rest.pt1.zuora.com |

    |US Production Copy | Submit a request at <a
    href="http://support.zuora.com/" target="_blank">Zuora Global Support</a> to
    enable the Zuora REST API in your tenant and obtain the base URL for REST
    endpoints. See [REST endpoint base URL of Production Copy (Service)
    Environment for existing and new
    customers](https://community.zuora.com/t5/API/REST-endpoint-base-URL-of-Production-Copy-Service-Environment/td-p/29611)
    for more information. |

    The Production endpoint provides access to your live user data. Sandbox
    tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If
    you would like Zuora to provision a Sandbox tenant for you, contact your
    Zuora representative for assistance.



    If you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to <a
    href="https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive"
    target="_blank">https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive</a> and sign
    up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data,
    including a sample product catalog.

    Community.


    # Authentication


    ## OAuth v2.0


    Zuora recommends that you use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate to the Zuora REST
    API. Currently, OAuth is not available in every environment. See [Zuora
    Testing
    Environments](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Environments)
    for more information.


    Zuora recommends you to create a dedicated API user with API write access on
    a tenant when authenticating via OAuth, and then create an OAuth client for
    this user. See <a
    href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User"
    target="_blank">Create an API User</a> for how to do this. By creating a
    dedicated API user, you can control permissions of the API user without
    affecting other non-API users.


    If a user is deactivated, all of the user's OAuth clients will be
    automatically deactivated.


    Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:

    1. Create a Client

    2. Generate a Token

    3. Make Authenticated Requests


    ### Create a Client


    You must first [create an OAuth
    client](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users#Create_an_OAuth_Client_for_a_User)
    in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora
    tenant. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID
    and a Client Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be
    required for the next step.


    **Note:** The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If you
    want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the
    owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the "API
    Write Access" permission.


    ### Generate a Token


    After creating a client, you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using
    the [Generate an OAuth
    token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken)
    operation. This operation requires the following parameters:

    - `client_id` - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in
    the previous step

    - `client_secret` - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth
    client in the previous step

    - `grant_type` - must be set to `client_credentials`


    **Note**: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed
    when you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The [Generate an OAuth
    token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken)
    response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. You should reuse
    the bearer token until it is expired. When the token is expired, call
    [Generate an OAuth
    token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken)
    again to generate a new one.


    ### Make Authenticated Requests


    To authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid bearer
    token in an HTTP header:


    `Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}`


    If you have [Zuora
    Multi-entity](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Entities)
    enabled, you need to set an additional header to specify the ID of the
    entity that you want to access. You can use the `scope` field in the
    [Generate an OAuth
    token](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/createToken)
    response to determine whether you need to specify an entity ID.


    If the `scope` field contains more than one entity ID, you must specify the
    ID of the entity that you want to access. For example, if the `scope` field
    contains `entity.1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc` and
    `entity.c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`, specify one of the following
    headers:

    - `Zuora-Entity-Ids: 1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc`

    - `Zuora-Entity-Ids: c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9`


    **Note**: For a limited period of time, Zuora will accept the `entityId`
    header as an alternative to the `Zuora-Entity-Ids` header. If you choose to
    set the `entityId` header, you must remove all "-" characters from the
    entity ID in the `scope` field.


    If the `scope` field contains a single entity ID, you do not need to specify
    an entity ID.


    ## Other Supported Authentication Schemes


    Zuora continues to support the following additional legacy means of
    authentication:

      * Use username and password. Include authentication with each request in the header: 
      
        * `apiAccessKeyId` 
        * `apiSecretAccessKey`
        
        Zuora recommends that you create an API user specifically for making API calls. See <a href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/Manage_Users/Create_an_API_User" target="_blank">Create an API User</a> for more information.
      
      * Use an authorization cookie. The cookie authorizes the user to make calls to the REST API for the duration specified in  **Administration > Security Policies > Session timeout**. The cookie expiration time is reset with this duration after every call to the REST API. To obtain a cookie, call the [Connections](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Connections) resource with the following API user information: 
      
        *   ID    
        *   Password
        
      * For CORS-enabled APIs only: Include a 'single-use' token in the request header, which re-authenticates the user with each request. See below for more details.

    ### Entity Id and Entity Name


    The `entityId` and `entityName` parameters are only used for [Zuora
    Multi-entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity
    "Zuora Multi-entity"). These are the legacy parameters that Zuora will only
    continue to support for a period of time. Zuora recommends you to use the
    `Zuora-Entity-Ids` parameter instead.



    The  `entityId` and `entityName` parameters specify the Id and the [name of
    the
    entity](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/B_Introduction_to_Entity_and_Entity_Hierarchy#Name_and_Display_Name
    "Introduction to Entity and Entity Hierarchy") that you want to access,
    respectively. Note that you must have permission to access the entity. 


    You can specify either the `entityId` or `entityName` parameter in the
    authentication to access and view an entity.

      * If both `entityId` and `entityName` are specified in the authentication, an error occurs. 
      * If neither `entityId` nor `entityName` is specified in the authentication, you will log in to the entity in which your user account is created. 

      

    To get the entity Id and entity name, you can use the GET Entities REST
    call. For more information, see [API User
    Authentication](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/A_Overview_of_Multi-entity#API_User_Authentication
    "API User Authentication").
      
      ### Token Authentication for CORS-Enabled APIs
      
      The CORS mechanism enables REST API calls to Zuora to be made directly from your customer's browser, with all credit card and security information transmitted directly to Zuora. This minimizes your PCI compliance burden, allows you to implement advanced validation on your payment forms, and  makes your payment forms look just like any other part of your website.

      
    For security reasons, instead of using cookies, an API request via CORS uses
    **tokens** for authentication.


    The token method of authentication is only designed for use with requests
    that must originate from your customer's browser; **it should  not be
    considered a replacement to the existing cookie authentication** mechanism.


    See [Zuora CORS
    REST](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/C_REST_API/Zuora_CORS_REST
    "Zuora CORS REST") for details on how CORS works and how you can begin to
    implement customer calls to the Zuora REST APIs. See  [HMAC
    Signatures](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POSTHMACSignature
    "HMAC Signatures") for details on the HMAC method that returns the
    authentication token.


    # Requests and Responses


    ## Request IDs 

    As a general rule, when asked to supply a "key" for an account or
    subscription (accountKey, account-key, subscriptionKey, subscription-key),
    you can provide either the actual ID or  the number of the entity.


    ## HTTP Request Body


    Most of the parameters and data accompanying your requests will be contained
    in the body of the HTTP request. 


    The Zuora REST API accepts JSON in the HTTP request body. No other data
    format (e.g., XML) is supported.


    ### Data Type


    ([Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and
    CRUD operations only) We recommend that you do not specify the decimal
    values with quotation marks, commas, and spaces. Use characters of
    `+-0-9.eE`, for example, `5`, `1.9`, `-8.469`, and `7.7e2`. Also, Zuora does
    not convert currencies for decimal values.



    ## Making asynchronous requests


    Most Zuora REST API endpoints documented in this API Reference process
    requests synchronously. In high-throughput scenarios, your requests to these
    endpoints are usually rate limited. 


    One strategy for avoiding rate limits is to make asynchronous requests, and
    Zuora provides this option to you.


    Making asynchronous requests allows you to scale your applications more
    efficiently by leveraging Zuora's infrastructure to enqueue and execute
    requests for you without blocking. These requests also use built-in retry
    semantics, which makes them much less likely to fail for non-deterministic
    reasons, even in extreme high-throughput scenarios. 

    Meanwhile, when you send a request to one of these endpoints, you can
    receive a response in less than 150 milliseconds and these calls are
    unlikely to trigger rate limit errors. 


    You can make asynchronous requests to the POST, PUT, or DELETE operations,
    except
    [Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions), for
    all resources documented in this API Reference.


    Take the following steps to take advantage of the asynchronous API:

      1. Set up callout notification
      2. Make asynchronous requests

    The following sections describes the high-level steps for you to get the
    most of the asynchronous API. For detailed instructions, see [Make
    asynchronous
    requests](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Make_asynchronous_requests)
    in the Knowledge Center. 


    ### Set up notifications


    You can create callout notification definitions based on the following
    custom events through the Zuora UI or the [Create a notification
    definition](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Create_Notification_Definition)
    API operation:
      * Async Request Succeeded
      * Async Request Failed

    This step ensures that your system receives a callout when an asynchronous
    request succeeds or fails.



    ### Make asynchronous requests


    By design, asynchronous requests differ from their synchronous counterparts
    in endpoints, and the HTTP status response code and response body they
    return. ​​The header parameters and request body schema for asynchronous
    operations are the same as their synchronous counterparts. 


    * The endpoints for asynchronous API operations contain `/async` in the path
    after `/v1`. See the following table for examples:


    | Operation               | Synchronous endpoint  | Asynchronous
    endpoint      |

    |:-------- |:-------- |:-------- |

    | Create an account       | `/v1/accounts`        |
    `/v1/async/accounts`       |

    | CRUD: Create an account | `/v1/object/account`  |
    `/v1/async/object/account` |


    * Unlike the 200 OK response for synchronous requests, Zuora returns a 202
    Accepted response for all asynchronous requests, and the response body
    contains only a request ID. 


    **Note**: These asynchronous API endpoints are in addition to the previously
    introduced endpoints that support asynchronous processing. You should
    continue to use them:
      * [Perform a mass action](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_MassUpdater)
      * [Create an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)
      * [Preview an order asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)
      * [Create a job to hard delete billing document files](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_BillingDocumentFilesDeletionJob)
      * [CRUD: Post or cancel a bill run](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_PUTBillRun)
      * [Cancel a journal run](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_JournalRun)
      * [Run trial balance](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_RunTrialBalance)

    For more information, see [Make asynchronous
    requests](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Make_asynchronous_requests).


    ## Testing a Request


    Use a third party client, such as [curl](https://curl.haxx.se "curl"),
    [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com "Postman"), or [Advanced REST
    Client](https://advancedrestclient.com "Advanced REST Client"), to test the
    Zuora REST API.


    You can test the Zuora REST API from the Zuora API Sandbox or Production
    tenants. If connecting to Production, bear in mind that you are working with
    your live production data, not sample data or test data.


    ## Testing with Credit Cards


    Sooner or later it will probably be necessary to test some transactions that
    involve credit cards. For suggestions on how to handle this, see [Going Live
    With Your Payment
    Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards
    "C_Zuora_User_Guides/A_Billing_and_Payments/M_Payment_Gateways/C_Managing_Payment_Gateways/B_Going_Live_Payment_Gateways#Testing_with_Credit_Cards"

    ).


    ## Concurrent Request Limits


    Zuora enforces tenant-level concurrent request limits. See <a
    href="https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits"
    target="_blank">Concurrent Request Limits</a> for more information.


    ## Timeout Limit


    If a request does not complete within 120 seconds, the request times out and
    Zuora returns a Gateway Timeout error.



    # Error Handling


    If a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with `/v1`
    (except
    [Actions](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#tag/Actions) and
    CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error code
    with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the error.


    The following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error
    code and message pair:


    ```
     {
       "success": false,
       "processId": "CBCFED6580B4E076",
       "reasons":  [
         {
          "code": 53100320,
          "message": "'termType' value should be one of: TERMED, EVERGREEN"
         }
        ]
     }
    ```

    The `success` field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The
    `processId` field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora
    Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.


    The `reasons` field contains the actual error code and message pair. The
    error code begins with `5` or `6` means that you encountered a certain issue
    that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing. For example,
    `53100320` indicates that an invalid value is specified for the `termType`
    field of the `subscription` object.


    The error code beginning with `9` usually indicates that an
    authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other
    unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, `90000011`
    indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header. 


    When troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two
    components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the
    following Zuora error code sample:


    <a href="https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg"
    target="_blank"><img
    src="https://assets.zuora.com/zuora-documentation/ZuoraErrorCode.jpeg"
    alt="Zuora Error Code Sample"></a>



    **Note:** Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload.
    Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you
    will get `500000` as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object
    and an unknown field. 

    The error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules
    described in the [Error Category
    Code](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Error-Handling/Error-Category-Code)
    section. 

    In such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.



    ## REST API Resource Code


    The 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field
    of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example,
    `531003` refers to the `termType` field of the `subscription` object. 


    The value range for all REST API resource codes is from `500000` to
    `679999`. See [Resource
    Codes](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/AA_REST_API/Resource_Codes)
    in the Knowledge Center for a full list of resource codes.


    ## Error Category Code


    The 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example,
    resource not found or missing required field. 


    The following table describes all error categories and the corresponding
    resolution:


    | Code    | Error category              | Description    | Resolution    |

    |:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|

    | 10      | Permission or access denied | The request cannot be processed
    because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. | Check the missing
    tenant or user permission in the response message and contact [Zuora Global
    Support](https://support.zuora.com) for enablement. |

    | 11      | Authentication failed       | Authentication fails due to
    invalid API authentication credentials. | Ensure that a valid API credential
    is specified. |

    | 20      | Invalid format or value     | The request cannot be processed
    due to an invalid field format or value. | Check the invalid field in the
    error message, and ensure that the format and value of all fields you passed
    in are valid. |

    | 21      | Unknown field in request    | The request cannot be processed
    because an unknown field exists in the request body. | Check the unknown
    field name in the response message, and ensure that you do not include any
    unknown field in the request body. |

    | 22      | Missing required field      | The request cannot be processed
    because a required field in the request body is missing. | Check the missing
    field name in the response message, and ensure that you include all required
    fields in the request body. |

    | 23      | Missing required parameter  | The request cannot be processed
    because a required query parameter is missing. | Check the missing parameter
    name in the response message, and ensure that you include the parameter in
    the query. |

    | 30      | Rule restriction            | The request cannot be processed
    due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. | Check the response message
    and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. |

    | 40      | Not found                   | The specified resource cannot be
    found. | Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource
    exists in your Zuora tenant. |

    | 45      | Unsupported request         | The requested endpoint does not
    support the specified HTTP method. | Check your request and ensure that the
    endpoint and method matches. |

    | 50      | Locking contention          | This request cannot be processed
    because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by
    another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. | <p>Resubmit the
    request first to have another try.</p> <p>If this error still occurs,
    contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) with the returned
    `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance.</p> |

    | 60      | Internal error              | The server encounters an internal
    error. | Contact [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com) with the
    returned `Zuora-Request-Id` value in the response header for assistance. |

    | 70      | Request exceeded limit      | The total number of concurrent
    requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. | <p>Resubmit the request
    after the number of seconds specified by the `Retry-After` value in the
    response header.</p> <p>Check [Concurrent request
    limits](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Policies/Concurrent_Request_Limits)
    for details about Zuora’s concurrent request limit policy.</p> |

    | 90      | Malformed request           | The request cannot be processed
    due to JSON syntax errors. | Check the syntax error in the JSON request body
    and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. |

    | 99      | Integration error           | The server encounters an error
    when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway,
    tax engine provider. | Check the response message and take action
    accordingly. |



    # Pagination


    When retrieving information (using GET methods), the optional `pageSize`
    query parameter sets the maximum number of rows to return in a response. The
    maximum is `40`; larger values are treated as `40`. If this value is empty
    or invalid, `pageSize` typically defaults to `10`.


    The default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden
    at the method level.


    If more rows are available, the response will include a `nextPage` element,
    which contains a URL for requesting the next page.  If this value is not
    provided, no more rows are available. No "previous page" element is
    explicitly provided; to support backward paging, use the previous call.


    ## Array Size


    For data items that are not paginated, the REST API supports arrays of up to
    300 rows.  Thus, for instance, repeated pagination can retrieve thousands of
    customer accounts, but within any account an array of no more than 300 rate
    plans is returned.


    # API Versions


    The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora
    REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor
    version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST
    request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the
    API.


    ## Major Version


    The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently,
    Zuora only supports the **v1** major version. For example, `POST
    https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions`.


    ## Minor Version


    Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For
    example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to
    replace it. 


    Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a
    field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all
    minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in
    version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request
    header to process without an error. 


    If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version
    or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field
    with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions.
    For example, the `invoiceCollect` field in the POST Subscription method is
    in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use
    this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.


    If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported,
    Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API
    documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we
    note that in the field description.


    You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require
    a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the `zuora-version`
    parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request
    call. For example, the `collect` field is in 196.0 minor version. If you
    want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the 
    `zuora-version` parameter to `196.0` in the request header. The
    `zuora-version` parameter is case sensitive.


    For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not
    specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of
    the REST API to avoid breaking your integration. 


    ### Minor Version History


    The supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the
    changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.


    The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a
    Zuora REST API minor version.

    ## API Names


    You can use the [Describe
    object](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_Describe)
    operation to list the fields of each Zuora object that is available in your
    tenant. When you call the operation, you must specify the API name of the
    Zuora object.


    The following table provides the API name of each Zuora object:

  - name: Actions
    description: >
      Actions are operations that are batch in nature. For example, the
      "create", "update", "delete", and other operations allow changes to up-to
      50 objects at a time. The "query" operation will return up-to 2000 result
      records back at a time, before requiring additional pages of data to be
      returned via a subsequent "queryMore" operation.


      The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. If you want to change the WSDL
      version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version` header. To find out in which WSDL
      version a particular object or field was introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API
      Version
      History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).


      **Note**: Actions do not support the Invoice Settlement feature. This
      feature includes Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice
      Item Settlement. Actions also do not support the Orders feature.

      Some operations in this section are similar to each other, but are
      provided for different use scenarios. You should choose the one that best
      suits your needs.


      For example, the [Create
      account](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Account)
      operation is used to create an account with a credit card payment method,
      a bill-to contact, and optionally an sold-to contact or an associated
      subscription. If you want to create an account without creating any
      associated objects such as subscriptions, use [CRUD: Create
      Account](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTAccount)
      instead.


      If you want to create an account and the associated subscription at the
      same time without providing credit card information, use the
      [Subscribe](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTsubscribe)
      action.
  - name: Amendments
    description: >
      You can use amendments to modify subscriptions. However, Zuora recommends
      you to use [Update
      subscription](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/PUT_Subscription)
      (recommended) or
      [Amend](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTamend)
      to do so.

      A communication profile enables you to send specific event-driven

      For more information, see [Communication

      You can manage communication profiles using the REST API:

        - [Retrieve a communication profile](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_GETCommunicationProfile)
        - [Retrieve all notifications under a communication profile (using the Settings API)](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/BB_C_Settings_API/Settings_API_tutorials/Get_all_Notifications_under_a_particular_Communication_Profile)

    description: >
      With Custom Objects service, you can define custom objects, extending the
      Zuora data model to accommodate your specific use cases.


      If you use Postman, you can import the custom objects endpoints as a
      collection into your Postman app and try out different requests to learn
      how the API works. Click the following button to get started:


      [![Run in
      Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.getpostman.com/run-collection/1f068ba43651bf63c0d4)


      You can sign up for a free account on the [Postman
      website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup) and download the app in
      case you do not use Postman yet.


      Note that the Custom Object Definitions API is versioned by
      `Zuora-Version` in the request header. The response may be different for
      the same request with a different API version. Specify `Zuora-Version` in
      the request header if you expect a specific response schema.


      ### Error handling      

      If the Custom Objects API call fails, an error code will be returned in
      the response body. See [Custom Objects API error
      code](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Custom_Objects/Z_Custom_Objects_API#Custom_Objects_API_error_code)

      how the API works. Click the following button to get started:


      [![Run in
      Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://www.getpostman.com/run-collection/1f068ba43651bf63c0d4)


      You can sign up for a free account on the [Postman
      website](https://identity.getpostman.com/signup) and download the app in
      case you do not use Postman yet.


      Note that the Custom Object Records API is versioned by `Zuora-Version` in
      the request header. The response may be different for the same request
      with a different API version. Specify `Zuora-Version` in the request
      header if you expect a specific response schema.


      ### Error handling      

      If the Custom Objects API call fails, an error code will be returned in
      the response body. See [Custom Objects API error
      code](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Custom_Objects/Z_Custom_Objects_API#Custom_Objects_API_error_code)
      for details.

  - name: Custom Payment Method Types
    description: >
      Open Payment Method (OPM) service is a framework developed by Zuora, which
      allows you to integrate your custom payment method to Zuora subscription,
      billing, and revenue management in a dynamic and flexible manner. With the
      support of the OPM service, you are able to define your custom payment
      method types and create custom payment methods of the defined types. The
      custom payment method of the defined type can only be used with the custom
      payment gateway that you set up through the Universal Payment Connector
      (UPC) service. It cannot be used with the Zuora out-of-box gateway
      integrations such as GoCardless, Stripe, etc.


      You can define up to 20 custom payment method types for one tenant. Do not
      define your fields with the [Zuora-reserved
      fields](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/MB_Set_up_custom_payment_gateways_and_payment_methods/C_Configure_and_manage_your_custom_payment_method_types_through_Zuora_REST_APIs#Zuora-reserved_fields).


      See [Set up custom payment gateways and payment
      methods](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/MB_Set_up_custom_payment_gateways_and_payment_methods)
      for more information about the OPM and UPC services.


      Note: You can only use the bearer token to access the "Custom Payment
      Method Types" API operations. Access with `apiAccessKeyId` and
      `apiSecretAccessKey` is not supported.
  - name: Data Queries
    description: >
      The Data Query feature enables you to perform SQL queries in your Zuora
      tenant. To learn how to get started with Data Query, see [Overview of Data

      conditions that are defined on [Zuora Business Object
      Model](http://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Business_Objects_Relationship).
      When a Zuora object changes, the trigger conditions defined on the object
      are evaluated, and if any condition qualifies, a business event will be
      triggered and turned into a notification.


      **Note**: Event Triggers operations are only applicable to custom events.

      Notifications are the actions taken to inform users or call third-party
      endpoints when a certain event happens. Typical actions include emails and
      callouts. Callouts typically refer to HTTP invocations, such as HTTP calls
      to REST services.


      **NOTE:** Notifications are processed asynchronously and may be delivered
      with a delay and out of order.


      Notifications are associated with Communication Profiles, which allow you
      to send specific event-driven notifications to targeted customers. Zuora
      provides the following Settings API to access the settings of
      Communication Profiles:
