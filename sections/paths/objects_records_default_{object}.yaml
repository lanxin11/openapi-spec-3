  summary: Create custom object records
  operationId: POST_CustomObjectRecords
  description: >
    Creates custom object records with the given type. 


    Upon creating records of a custom object type, the 200 response contains a
    list of records that have been successfully processed and stored.



    ## Limitations 


    This call has the following limitations:

    * The maximum number of records that you can create by one call is 1,000.

    * The storage of empty strings in records is not supported.

    * Null values must be formatted as the following example: 
      ```
      {
        "records": [
          {
            "fieldName__c": null
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

        The 200 response indicates that the records have been partially or
        completely created.


        * If the `allowPartialSuccess` flag is set to `false`, the 200 response
        indicates that all object records have been successfully created.

        * If the `allowPartialSuccess` flag is set to `true`, the 200 response
        indicates that some records might not be succesffully created and the
        error information might be contained in the response body.

    ## Limitations 


    This call has the following limitations:

    * When a record is created, there will be a delay before it is available for
    search. For example, if you create 5 records and perform a query that these
    5 records satisfy the query conditions, there will be a delay between when
    the 5 records are created, and when all the 5 records can be returned in the
    query result.
