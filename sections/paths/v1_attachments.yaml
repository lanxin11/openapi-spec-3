  operationId: POST_Attachments
  description: >
    Use the Add Attachment REST request with a multipart/form-data to attach a
    document file to an Account, a Subscription, an Invoice, a Credit Memo, or a
    Debit Memo.


    You can only use this operation if you have a Billing role that includes the
    Manage Attachments permission.

    For more information, see [Billing
    roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Tenant_Management/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles).

    To change your Billing role, contact your Zuora platform administrator.


    **Note**: The Credit and Debit Memos feature is only available if you have
    [Invoice
    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
    Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments,
    Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable
    Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist
    Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide)
    for more information.
