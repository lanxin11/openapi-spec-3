  summary: Create a billing preview run
  operationId: POST_BillingPreviewRun
  description: >
    Creates a billing preview run for multiple customer accounts.


    You can run up to 20 billing preview runs in batches concurrently. A single
    batch of customer accounts can only have one billing preview run at a time.
    So you can have up to 20 batches running at the same time. If you create a
    billing preview run for all customer batches, you cannot create another
    billing preview run until this preview run is completed.
