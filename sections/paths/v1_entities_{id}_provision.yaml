    Provisions an entity. You can only provision an entity if its parent entity
    is provisioned.


    ## User Access Permission

    You must make the call as a global entity administrator. 


    ## Notes

    * Zuora does not allow you to remove a provisioned entity from the
    multi-entity hierarchy. So before you provision an entity, make sure that
    you put the entity in the correct place in the multi-entity hierarchy.
