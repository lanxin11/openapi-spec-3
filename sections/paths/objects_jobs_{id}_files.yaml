  summary: Upload a file for a custom object bulk job
  description: >
    Uploads a file to a create custom object bulk job. Only one file is allowed
    per job. The job must be in `pending` status when you upload the file to it.
    The job will start creating records once the upload is finished.


    Only the users that have the "Edit Custom Objects" permission can upload
    files to custom object bulk jobs. See [Platform
    Permissions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Tenant_Management/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/h_Platform_Roles#Platform_Permissions)
    for more information.
