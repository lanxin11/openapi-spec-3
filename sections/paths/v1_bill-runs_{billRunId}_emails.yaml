  summary: Email billing documents generated from a bill run
  operationId: POST_EmailBillingDocumentsfromBillRun
  description: >
    Manually emails all the billing documents that are generated from a
    specified bill run to your customers. 



    Bill runs can generate invoices and credit memos based on your [invoice and
    credit memo generation
    rule](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/Credit_and_Debit_Memos/Rules_for_Generating_Invoices_and_Credit_Memos).
    Credit memos are only available if you have the Invoice Settlement feature
    enabled.



    Using this API operation, the billing documents are sent to the email
    addresses specified in the **To Email** field of the email templates. The
    email template used for each billing document is set in the **Delivery
    Options** panel of the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. See
    [Edit Email
    Templates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/Create_Email_Templates)
    for more information about how to edit the **To Email** field in the email
    template.






    ## Notes
      - Even though no field is required in the Request body, you still need to specify `{}` in the request. Otherwise, an error will be returned.


      - You can only email posted billing documents.
      
      
      - You must activate the following notifications before emailing invoices and credit memos:
        - **Manual Email For Invoice | Manual Email For Invoice** 
        - **Email Credit Memo | Manually email Credit Memo**
     
      
      - To include the invoice PDF in the email, select the **Include Invoice PDF** check box in the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. To include the credit memo PDF in the email, select the **Include Credit Memo PDF** check box in the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. See [Create and Edit Notifications](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/C_Create_Notifications#section_2) for more information.



      - Zuora sends the email messages based on the email template you set. You can set the email template to use in the **Delivery Options** panel of the **Edit notification** dialog from the Zuora UI. By default, the following templates are used for billing documents:
        - Invoices: **Invoice Posted Default Email Template**
        - Credit memos: **Manual Email for Credit Memo Default Template**  

        See [Create and Edit Email Templates](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Notifications/Create_Email_Templates) for more information.
