  operationId: PUT_RunTrialBalance
  description: >
    Runs the trial balance for an accounting period. 


    Prerequisites

    -------------


    * You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.


    * You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user
    permissions. See [Finance
    Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/f_Finance_Roles).

              
    Limitations 

    -----------
     
     * The accounting period must be open.
     
     * The accounting period cannot already be in the process of running a trial balance.

     
    Notes

    -----

    The trial balance is run asynchronously. A response of `{ "success": true }`
    means only that the trial balance has started processing, but does not mean
    that the trial balance has successfully completed. You can use the [Get
    Accounting
    Period](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/GET_AccountingPeriod)
    REST API call to view details about the outcome of the trial balance.
