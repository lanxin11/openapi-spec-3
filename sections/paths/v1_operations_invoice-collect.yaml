  summary: Invoice and collect
  operationId: POST_TransactionInvoicePayment
  description: >
    Generates and posts invoices and credit memos and collects payments for
    posted invoices. Credit memos are only available if you have the Invoice
    Settlement feature enabled and negative charges exist. Credit memos will not
    be applied to invoices. If draft invoices and credit memos exist when you
    run this operation, this operation will post the invoices and credit memos.
    Note that draft credit memos created from an invoice or a product rate plan
    charge will not be posted.


    You can use this operation to generate invoices and collect payments on the
    posted invoices,
     or else simply collect payment on a specified existing
    invoice. The customer's default payment method is used, and the full

    amount due is collected. The operation depends on the parameters you

    specify.


    - To generate one or more new invoices for that customer and collect

    payment on the generated and other unpaid invoice(s), leave the
    **invoiceId** field empty. 


    - To collect payment on an existing invoice, specify the invoice ID. 



    The operation is atomic; if any part is unsuccessful, the entire

    operation is rolled back.


    When an error occurs, gateway reason codes and error messages are returned
    the error response of this operation. The following items are some gateway
    response code examples.


    - Orbital: `05 Do Not Honor`; `14 Invalid Credit Card Number`

    - Vantiv: `301 Invalid Account Number`; `304 Lost/Stolen Card`  

    - CyberSource2: `202 Expired card`; `231 Invalid account number`


    For more reason code information, see the corresponding payment gateway
    documentation. 



    ## Notes


    Timeouts may occur when using this method on an account that

    has an extremely high number of subscriptions.
