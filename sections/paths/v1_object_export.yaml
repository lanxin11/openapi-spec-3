  summary: 'CRUD: Create an export'
  operationId: Object_POSTExport
  description: >
    Use this operation to create a data source export. After you have created a
    data source export, use [CRUD: Retrieve an
    export](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_GETExport)
    to check the status of the data source export and access the exported data.


    ## Limits


    Zuora system enforces the following limits on data source exports:


    * The maximum processing time per export is 3 hours. If an export is
    executed for longer than 3 hours, it will be killed automatically.

    * The maximum number of concurrent exports is 50 per tenant. Exports in
    `Pending` and `Processing` status are counted towards the concurrent export
    limit. Zuora system will reject the subsequent data source export requests
    once the concurrent export limit is reached.


    When you export data from Zuora, each exported file is available for
    download for 7 days. Data source exports (Export objects) older than 90 days
    are automatically deleted.


    **Note:** This operation supports the [Export
    ZOQL](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL) query
    language. However, this operation does not support some data sources,
    objects, and fields in Export ZOQL queries. For full compatibility with
    Export ZOQL, Zuora recommends that you use the [AQuA
    API](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/T_Aggregate_Query_API)
    instead of this operation.
