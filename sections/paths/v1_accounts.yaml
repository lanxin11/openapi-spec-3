  summary: Create an account
  operationId: POST_Account
  description: >
    Creates a customer account with a payment method, a bill-to contact, and an
    optional sold-to contact. Request and response field descriptions and sample
    code are provided. Use this operation to optionally create a subscription,
    invoice for that subscription, and collect payment through the default
    payment method. The transaction is atomic; if any part fails for any reason,
    the entire transaction is rolled back.


    This operation is CORS Enabled, so you can use client-side Javascript to
    invoke the call. 


    ## Notes

    1. The account is created in active status.  

    2. If the `autoPay` field is set to `true` in the request, you must provide
    one of the `paymentMethod`, `creditCard`, or `hpmCreditCardPaymentMethodId`
    field, but not multiple. The one provided becomes the default payment method
    for this account. If the credit card information is declined or cannot be
    verified, no account is created.

    3. Customer accounts created with this call are automatically be set to Auto
    Pay.

    4. If either the `workEmail` or `personalEmail` field is specified, then the
    account's email delivery preference is automatically set to `true`. (In that
    case, emails go to the `workEmail` address, if it exists, or else the
    `personalEmail`.) If neither field is specified, the email delivery
    preference is automatically set to `false`.
