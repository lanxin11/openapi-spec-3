  operationId: PUT_ScrubPaymentMethods
  description: >

    This operation enables you to replace all sensitive data in a payment
    method, related payment method snapshot table, and four related log tables
    with dummy values that will be stored in Zuora databases. 


    This operation will scrub the sensitive data and soft-delete the specified
    payment method at the same time. 


    If you want to delete or anonymize personal data in Zuora, you must scrub
    the payment method before anonymizing the associated account and contact.
    See [Delete or anonymize personal
    data](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Responding_to_individual_requests_for_access%2C_correction%2C_and_deletion_of_data_under_applicable_privacy_laws#Edit_and_correct_personal_data)
    for more information.

    Sensitive Data of Specific Payment Method payments** permission is enabled
    in your user role. Contact your tenant administrator if you want to enable
    this permission. See [Scrub Payment
