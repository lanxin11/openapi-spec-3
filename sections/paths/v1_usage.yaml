  summary: Upload a usage file
  operationId: POST_Usage
  description: >
    This REST API reference describes how to post or import usage data for one
    or more accounts in the CSV format. There are no path or query parameters.
    The data is uploaded using the HTTP multipart/form-data POST method and
    applied to the user's tenant. 


    For a use case of this operation, see [Upload usage
    records](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/#Upload-usage-records).


    ## How this REST API Call Works

    The content of the uploaded usage file must follow the format used by the UI
    import tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding
    .csv extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters.
    The file size must not exceed 4MB. See [Downloading the Usage
    Template](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/J_Billing_Operations/Usage/C_Import_Usage_Data#Downloading_the_Usage_Template)
    to learn about how to download the usage file template.


    At the completion of the upload, before the file contents are actually being
    processed, the API returns a response containing the byte count of the
    received file and a URL for checking the status of the import process.  Of
    the five possible results displayed at that URL (Pending, Processing,
    Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed status indicates that the
    import was successful.  The operation is atomic; if any record fails, the
    file is rejected. In that case, the entire import is rolled back and all
    stored data is returned to its original state.


    To view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the
    checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN. This additional
    step provides more information about why the import has failed.


    To manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI.


    ## Usage File Format

    The usage file uses the following headings: 


    | Heading         | Description   | Required |

    |-----------------|--------|----------|

    | ACCOUNT_ID      | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account
    number, such as A00000001, or your custom account number. Although this
    field is labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account
    Name.  | Yes      |

    | UOM             | Enter the unit of measure. This must match the UOM for
    the usage. | Yes      |

    | QTY             | Enter the quantity.  | Yes      |

    | STARTDATE       | Enter the start date of the usage. This date determines
    the invoice item service period the associated usage is billed to. Date
    format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format:
    `MM/DD/YYYY`. | Yes |

    | ENDDATE         | Enter the end date of the usage. This is not used in
    calculations for usage billing and is optional. Date format is based on
    locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. <p>**Note:**
    The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p>
    | No |

    | SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the subscription number or subscription name. If
    you created the subscription in the Zuora application, Zuora created a
    number automatically in a format similar to A-S00000001. If you do not
    provide a value for this field, the associated usage will be added to all
    subscriptions for the specified Account that use this Unit Of Measure. If
    your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or
    triple counting of usage, you must specify the Subscription or Charge ID in
    each usage record.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but
    the column header is required.</p>  | No   |

    | CHARGE_ID       | Enter the charge number (not the charge name). You can
    see the charge ID, e.g., C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your
    subscription and view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have
    multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of
    usage, you must specify the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage
    record. This field is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate
    plan.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column
    header is required.</p>  | No      |

    | DESCRIPTION     | Enter a description for the charge. | No       |

    | UNIQUE_KEY      | Enter a specific identifier for this usage record.
    **Note**: This Heading is only applicable if you have the [Prepaid with
    Drawdown](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/J_Billing_Operations/Prepaid_with_Drawdown)
    feature enabled. See [Upload usage record with unique
    key](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/J_Billing_Operations/Prepaid_with_Drawdown/Prepaid_balance_transactions#Upload_usage_record_with_unique_key)
    for more information.  | No      |
