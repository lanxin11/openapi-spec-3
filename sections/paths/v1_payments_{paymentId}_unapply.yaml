    **Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice
    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
    Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments,
    Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable
    Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist
    Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide)
    for more information. 


    Unapplies an applied payment from invoices and debit memos.


    When you unapply a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo
    items that the payment will unapply from must be less than or equal to
    15,000.


    If the limit is hit, you can follow the instructions:

    - If you want to unapply one payment without specifying invoices or debit
    memos, you have to specify the invoices or debit memos in the request.

    - If you want to unapply one payment from multiple specified invoices or
    debit memos, decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request.

    - If you want to unapply one payment from a single invoice or debit memo
    with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items in the
    request. The maximum number of invoice items that you can specify in the
    request is 1,000.

    Memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/Unapply_Payments_from_Invoices_and_Debit_Memos).
