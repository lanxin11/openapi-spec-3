  summary: Create a summary journal entry
  operationId: POST_SummaryJournalEntry
  description: >
    This REST API reference describes how to manually create a summary journal
    entry. Request and response field descriptions and sample code are provided.

    ## Requirements

    1.The sum of debits must equal the sum of credits in the summary journal
    entry.


    2.The following applies only if you use foreign currency conversion:
      * If you have configured Aggregate transactions with different currencies during a Journal Run to "Yes", the value of the **currency** field must be the same as your tenant's home currency. That is, you must create journal entries using your home currency.
      * All journal entries in an accounting period must either all be aggregated or all be unaggregated. You cannot have a mix of aggregated and unaggregated journal entries in the same accounting period.
