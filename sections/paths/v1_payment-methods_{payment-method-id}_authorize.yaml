    Enables you to authorize the availability of funds for a transaction but
    delay the capture of funds until a later time. Subsequently, use [CRUD:
    Create a
    payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTPayment)
    or [Create a
    payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreatePayment)
    to capture the authorized funds, or use [Cancel
    authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CancelAuthorization)
    to cancel the authorization. 


    The following payment gateways support this operation:


    * Adyen Integration v2.0

    * CyberSource 1.28

    * CyberSource 1.97

    * CyberSource 2.0 - This gateway supports the Delayed Capture feature for
    both Credit Cards and Credit Card Reference payment methods. This gateway
    does not support [Cancel
    authorization](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CancelAuthorization).

    * Chase Paymentech Orbital

    * Ingenico ePayments

    * SlimPay

    * Verifi Global Payment Gateway

    * WePay


    If you have the Invoice Settlement feature enabled, use the [Create
    payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreatePayment)
    operation to capture the funds instead of the [CRUD: Create
    payment](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Object_POSTPayment)
    operation.
