    Sends an authorization request to the corresponding payment gateway to
    verify the payment method, even though no changes are made for the payment
    method. Supported payment methods are Credit Cards and Paypal.


    Zuora now supports performing a standalone zero dollar verification or one
    dollar authorization for credit cards. It also supports a billing agreement
    status check on PayPal payment methods.


    If a payment method is created by Hosted Payment Pages and is not assigned
    to any billing account, the payment method cannot be verified through this
    operation.
