    **Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice
    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
    Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments,
    Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable
    Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist
    Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide)
    for more information.


    Applies a posted credit memo to one or more invoices and debit memos. 


    You can apply a credit memo to an invoice or a debit memo only if you have
    the user permission. See [Billing
    Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles)
    for more information.


    When you apply a credit memo, the total number of credit memo items and the
    items that credit memo items to be applied to must be less than or equal to
    15,000.


    If the limit is hit, you can follow the following instructions:


    - If you want to apply one credit memo to multiple invoices or debit memos,
    decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request.

    - If you want to apply one credit memo to a single invoice or debit memo
    with a large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items or debit
    memo items in the request. The maximum number of invoice items or debit memo
    items that you can specify in the request is 1,000.

    - If a credit memo has a large volume of items, you have to specify credit
    memo items in the request. The maximum number of credit memo items that you
    can specify in the request is 1,000.
            
    If the Proration application rule is used, when applying credit memos, the
    following quantity must be less than or equal to 15,000: 


    (number of invoice items + number of debit memo items) * number of credit
    memo items


    Otherwise, the First In First Out rule will be used instead of the Proration
    rule.
