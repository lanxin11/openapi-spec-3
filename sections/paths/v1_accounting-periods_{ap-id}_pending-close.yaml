    Prerequisites

    * You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant.

    * You must have the Manage Close Process and Run Trial Balance user
    permissions.

                
    Limitations 
     -----------
     
     * The accounting period cannot be closed or pending close.
     
     * The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance.
     
     * All earlier accounting periods must be closed.

     

     
    Notes

    -----

    When you set an accounting period to pending close in Zuora, a trial balance
    is automatically run for that period. A response of `{ "success": true }` 
    means only that the accounting period status is now pending close, but does
    not mean that the trial balance has successfully completed. You can use the
    Get Accounting Period REST API call to view details about the outcome of the
    trial balance.
