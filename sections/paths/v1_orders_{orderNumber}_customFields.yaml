  summary: Update order custom fields
  description: >
    **Note:** This feature is only available if you have the [Order
    Metrics](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders#Order_Metrics)
    feature enabled. As of Zuora Billing Release 284, Orders is generally
    available and the Order Metrics feature is no longer available as a
    standalone feature. If you are an existing Subscribe and Amend customer and
    want Order Metrics only, you must turn on [Orders
    Harmonization](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Orders_Harmonization/Orders_Harmonization).
    You can still keep the existing Subscribe and Amend API integrations to
    create and manage subscriptions.


    **Note:** To update the custom fields of an order line item, you must use
    the "Update an order line item" or "Update order line items" operation.


    Updates the custom fields of a specified order.
