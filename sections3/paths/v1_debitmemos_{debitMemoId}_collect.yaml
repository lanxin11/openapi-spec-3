    for more information.


    This API operation provides an easy way to let the client-side to collect an
    existing posted debit memo.

    It supports the following steps:
      1. Apply unapplied credit memos to the posted debit memo by Oldest-First-Largest-First rule if there are more than one unapplied credit memos.
      2. Apply unapplied payments to the posted debit memo by Oldest-First-Largest-First rule if there are more than one unapplied payments.
      3. Process payment to the posted debit memo if there is an open-balance on it.

    **Reistrictions**


    Since this API will do lots of works, and some of them are resource
    consuming, we need to resitrict the usage of this API by the following
    conditions:
      1. If the target debit memo gets more than 10 debit memo items, the request will be rejected.
      2. If `CreditMemo` is specified in `applicationOrder`, when there are more than 25 credit memos will be used to apply to the debit memo, the request will be rejected.
      3. If `CreditMemo` is specified in `applicationOrder`, when there are more than 100 credit memo items will be used to apply to the debit memo, the request will be rejected.
      4. If `UnappliedPayment` is specified in `applicationOrder`, when there are more than 25 payments will be used to apply to the debit memo, the request will be rejected.
