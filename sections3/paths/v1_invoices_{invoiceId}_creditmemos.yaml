    **Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice
    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
    Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments,
    Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable
    Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist

    for more information. 


    Creates an ad-hoc credit memo from an invoice.


    You can create a credit memo from an invoice only if you have the user
    permission. See [Billing
    Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles)
    for more information.


    For a use case of this operation, see [Create credit
    memo](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/#Create-credit-memo).


    Zero-amount memo items are supported in the following scenarios:

    - If you want to correct taxation items only for an invoice, you can set the
    memo item amount to zero, but the taxation item amount to non-zero.

    - If you want to correct personal data in an invoice, you can set the memo
    item amount to zero to create a zero-amount credit memo from an invoice.
