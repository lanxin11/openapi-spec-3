  operationId: PUT_CloseAccountingPeriod
  description: >-
    Close an accounting period by accounting period ID.


    Prerequisites

    -------------

    You must have Zuora Finance enabled on your tenant. You must have the Manage
    Close Process and Run Trial Balance user permissions.


    Limitations

    -----------

    * The accounting period cannot already be closed.

    * The accounting period cannot be in the process of running a trial balance.

    * All earlier accounting periods must be closed.

    * There must be no required action items for the accounting period. See
    Reconcile Transactions Before Closing an Accounting Period for more
    information.


    Notes

    -----

    When you close an accounting period in Zuora, a trial balance is
    automatically run for that period. A successful response means only that the
    accounting period is now closed, but does not mean that the trial balance
    has successfully completed.
