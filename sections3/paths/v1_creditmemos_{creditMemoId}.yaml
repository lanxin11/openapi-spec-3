    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
    Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments,
    Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable
    Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist

    for more information. 


    Updates the basic and finance information about a credit memo. Currently,
    Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support
    updating tax-inclusive memo items. 


    If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the
    following conditions:
      - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.
      - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.

    You can update a credit memo only if you have the user permission. See
    [Billing
    Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles)
    for more information.
