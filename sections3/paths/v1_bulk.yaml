  summary: Perform a mass action
  operationId: POST_MassUpdater
  description: >
    Describes how to perform a mass action through the REST API. 


    Using this API method, you send a multipart/form-data request containing a
    `.csv` file with data about the mass action you want to perform. Zuora
    returns a key and then asynchronously processes the mass action. You can use
    the key to get details about the result of the mass action.


    If you want to use this operation to perform the Mass Payment Upload (MPU)
    mass action, see [Mass Payment
    Upload](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Finance/Mass_Updater/Mass_Payment_Upload)
    for more information.

                File containing data about the mass action you want to perform.
                The file requirements are the same as when uploading a file
                through the Mass Updater in the Zuora UI. The file must be a
                `.csv` file or a zipped `.csv` file.


                The maximum file size is 4 MB.


                The data in the file must be formatted according to the mass
                action type you want to perform.

                Container for the following fields. You must format this
                parameter as a JSON object.


                * `actionType` (string, **Required**) - Type of mass action you
                want to perform. The following mass actions are supported:
                `UpdateAccountingCode`, `CreateRevenueSchedule`,
                `UpdateRevenueSchedule`, `DeleteRevenueSchedule`,
                `ImportFXRate`, and `MPU`.


                * `checksum` (string) - An MD5 checksum that is used to validate
                the integrity of
                  the uploaded file. The checksum is a 32-character string.
