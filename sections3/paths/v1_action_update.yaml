  summary: Update
  operationId: Action_POSTupdate
  description: >

    Updates the information in one or more objects of the same type. You can
    specify different types of objects in different update calls, but each
    specific update call must apply to only one type of object.


    You can update an array of one or more zObjects. It returns an array of
    SaveResults sorted in the same order, indicating the success or failure of
    updating each object. The following information applies to this call:


    * You cannot pass in null zObjects.

    * You can pass in a maximum of 50 zObjects at a time.

    * All objects must be of the same type.

    * For each field in each object, you must determine that object's ID. Then
    populate the fields that you want update with the new information.

    * Zuora ignores unrecognized fields in update calls. For example, if an
    optional field is spelled incorrectly or a field that does not exist is
    specified, Zuora ignores the field and continues to process the call. No
    error message is returned for unrecognized fields.


    ## Limitations 


    This call has the following limitations:


    * A maximum of 50 objects are supported in a single call.

    * The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes
    Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

    * The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To update objects or fields
    according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version`
    header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was
    introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version
    History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).
