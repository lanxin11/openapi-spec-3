    **Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice
    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
    Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments,
    Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable
    Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist
    Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide)
    for more information.


    Creates multiple credit memos from invoices or product rate plan charges.
    You can create a maximum of 50 credit memos in one single request. 


    - If you set the `sourceType` request field to `Invoice`, you can create
    multiple credit memos from invoices.

    - If you set the `sourceType` request field to `Standalone`, you can create
    multiple credit memos from product rate plan charges.


    The credit memos that are created are each in separate database
    transactions. If the creation of one credit memo fails, other credit memos
    can still be created successfully. 


    You can create credit memos only if you have the user permission. See
    [Billing
    Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles)
    for more information.


    Zero-amount memo items are supported in the following scenarios:

    - If you want to correct taxation items only for an invoice, you can set the
    memo item amount to zero, but the taxation item amount to non-zero.

    - If you want to correct personal data in an invoice, you can set the memo
    item amount to zero to create a zero-amount credit memo from an invoice.

    enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
    Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments,

    for more information.

      Updates the basic and finance information about multiple credit memos. You can update a maximum of 50 credit memos in one single request.
      
      The credit memos that are updated are each in separate database transactions. If the update of one credit memo fails, other credit memos can still be updated successfully. 
      
      Currently, Zuora supports updating tax-exclusive memo items, but does not support updating tax-inclusive memo items.

      If the amount of a memo item is updated, the tax will be recalculated in the following conditions:
      - The memo is created from a product rate plan charge and you use Avalara to calculate the tax.
      - The memo is created from an invoice and you use Avalara or Zuora Tax to calculate the tax.

      You can update credit memos only if you have the user permission. See [Billing Roles](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/A_Administrator_Settings/User_Roles/d_Billing_Roles) for more information.
