  summary: QueryMore
  operationId: Action_POSTqueryMore
  description: >
    Use queryMore to request additional results from a previous query call. If
    your initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use
    queryMore to query for the additional results.



    Any `queryLocator` results greater than 2,000, will only be stored by Zuora
    for 5 days before it is deleted.


     This call sends a request for additional results from an initial query call. If the initial query call returns more than 2000 results, you can use the `queryLocator` returned from query to request the next set of results.


    **Note:** Zuora expires queryMore cursors after 15 minutes of activity.



    To use queryMore, you first construct a query call. By default, the query
    call will return up to 2000 results. If there are more than 2000 results,
    query will return a boolean `done`, which will be marked as `false`, and a
    `queryLocator`, which is a marker you will pass to queryMore to get the next
    set of results.
