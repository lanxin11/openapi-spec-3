  summary: Create an event trigger
  description: >
    When you create an event trigger, you must specify the base object and
    define the trigger condition.


    ### Specify the base object

    Use `baseObject` field to specify which object to define a trigger on. You
    can define an event trigger on any of the following objects:

      * Account
      * AccountingCode
      * AccountingPeriod
      * Amendment
      * BillingRun
      * Contact
      * CreditBalanceAdjustment
      * CreditMemo
      * CreditMemoApplication
      * CreditMemoApplicationItem
      * CreditMemoItem
      * DebitMemo
      * DebitMemoItem
      * Feature
      * Invoice
      * InvoiceAdjustment
      * InvoiceItem
      * InvoiceItemAdjustment
      * JournalEntry
      * JournalEntryItem
      * Order
      * OrderAction
      * OrderLineItem
      * Payment
      * PaymentApplication
      * PaymentMethod
      * PaymentPart
      * Product
      * ProductFeature
      * ProductRatePlan
      * ProductRatePlanCharge
      * ProductRatePlanChargeTier
      * RatePlan
      * RatePlanCharge
      * RatePlanChargeTier
      * Refund
      * RefundApplication
      * RevenueEvent
      * RevenueEventItem
      * RevenueSchedule
      * RevenueScheduleItem
      * Subscription
      * SubscriptionProductFeature
      * TaxationItem
      * Usage

    #### Tenant level base objects and tenant level event triggers

    Zuora identifies the following base objects as the tenant level base
    objects:

      * AccountingCode
      * AccountingPeriod
      * BillingRun
      * Feature
      * JournalEntry
      * JournalEntryItem
      * Product
      * ProductFeature
      * ProductRatePlan
      * ProductRatePlanCharge
      * ProductRatePlanChargeTier

    Event triggers defined on tenant level base objects are tenant level event
    triggers. Notifications associated with tenant level events are system
    notifications. 


    **Note:** Tenant level event triggers and system notifications are only
    available in the default profile.        


    ### Define the trigger condition

    The `condition` field is a
    [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/) expression that
    specifies when to trigger events. The expression can contain fields from the
    object that the trigger is defined on.


    **Note:** The condition cannot contain fields from [data
    source](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL)
    objects that are joined to the object that the trigger is defined on.


    For example, the following condition causes an event to be triggered
    whenever an invoice is posted with an amount greater than 1000:


    ```changeType == 'UPDATE' && Invoice.Status == 'Posted' &&
    Invoice.Status_old != 'Posted' && Invoice.Amount > 1000```


    Where:

      * `changeType` is a keyword that specifies the type of change that occurred to the Invoice object. For all objects, the supported values of `changeType` are `INSERT`, `UPDATE`,  and `DELETE`.
      * `Invoice.Status` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field after the change occurred.
      * `Invoice.Status_old` is the value of the Invoice object's `Status` field before the change occurred.

    In the above example, the value of `baseObject` is `Invoice`.


    ### Limitations 


    This event trigger has the following limitations:


    * The INSERT change type is not supported on RatePlan base objects.


    * The INSERT change type is not supported on SubscriptionProductFeature base
    objects.


    * When creating custom events, you cannot match fields of the RatePlanCharge
    object against constant values for the `condition` field. For example, the
    following condition will cause errors:
    `RatePlanCharge.ShippingProcessStatus__c == 'Shipping Confirmed'`, where
    `Shipping Confirmed` is a constant value.


    * Fields on objects are case-sensitive. For example,
    `PaymentMethod.createdbyid` can result in errors. The correct format is
    `PaymentMethod.CreatedById`. 


    * A condition cannot contain fields from data source objects that are joined
    to the base object.


    * Do not create duplicate events because they will be either merged or
    deleted. Zuora considers events that have the same trigger condition as
    duplicate events, regardless of event type names.
