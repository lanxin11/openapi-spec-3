  summary: Scrub a contact
  operationId: PUT_ScrubContact
  description: >

    Scrubs the sensitive data of a specific contact. 


    You can use this operation to replace all sensitive data in a contact and
    its related contact snapshot with dummy values that will be stored in Zuora
    databases. 


    After scrubbing a contact, it is good practice to delete it. Otherwise, it
    might cause errors in subsequent operations.


    **Note**: To use this operation, you must ensure that the "Scrub Sensitive
    Data of Contact" billing permission is enabled in your user role. Contact
    your tenant administrator if you want to enable this permission. See [Scrub
    Contacts](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Customer_Accounts/A_How_to_Manage_Customer_Accounts/B_Key_Contacts/Scrub_Contacts)
    for more information.
