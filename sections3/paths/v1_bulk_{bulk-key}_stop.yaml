  summary: Stop a mass action
  operationId: PUT_MassUpdater
  description: >
    Describes how to stop a mass action through the REST API. You can stop a
    mass action when its status is Pending or Processing. After you have stopped
    a mass action, you can get the mass action result to see details of the mass
    action.


    - If you stop a mass action when its status is Pending, no response file is
    generated because no records have been processed.


    - If you stop a mass action when its status is Processing, a response file
    is generated. You can check the response file to see which records have been
    processed and which have not. In the response file, the **Success** column
    has the value `Y` (successful) or `N` (failed) for processed records, and a
    blank value for unprocessed records.


    Records that have already been processed when a mass action is stopped are
    not rolled back.
