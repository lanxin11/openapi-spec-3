    **Note:** This operation is only available if you have [Invoice
    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
    Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments,
    Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable
    Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist
    Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide)
    for more information. 


    Applies an unapplied payment to invoices and debit memos.


    When you apply a payment, the total number of invoice items and debit memo
    items that the payment will apply to must be less than or equal to 15,000.
            
    If the limit is hit, you can follow the instructions:

    - If you want to apply one payment to multiple invoices or debit memos,
    decrease the number of invoices or debit memos in the request.

    - If you want to apply one payment to a single invoice or debit memo with a
    large volume of items, you have to specify invoice items in the request. The
    maximum number of invoice items that you can specify in the request is
    1,000.


    For more information, see [Apply Unapplied Payments to Invoices and Debit
    Memos](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Invoice_Settlement/A_Unapplied_Payments/Management_of_Unapplied_Payments/Apply_Unapplied_Payments_to_Invoices_and_Debit_Memos).
