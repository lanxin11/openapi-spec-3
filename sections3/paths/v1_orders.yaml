    You can use this operation to create subscriptions and make changes to
    subscriptions by creating orders. You can also use this operation to create
    order line items by creating orders. The following tutorials demonstrate how
    to use this operation:

     * [Create a Subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/AC_Orders_Tutorials/A_Create_a_Subscription)

     * [Create an order line item with a new subscription](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Line_Items/Create_an_order_line_item_with_a_new_subscription)

    You can also see the [API
    Guides](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-guides/) for more use cases of
    the "Create an order" operation.


    Creating a draft order is currently not supported. See [Known Limitations in
    Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Orders/C_Known_Limitations_in_Orders)
    for additional limitations.


    The limit of orders allowed on a subscription is 1000.


    The limit of order line items allowed in an order is 100.


    Zuora has the following limits on the Orders synchronous API to prevent
    performance degradation: 

    * Up to 50 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an
    order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order)
    or [Preview an
    order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder)
    operation call.

    * Up to 50 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an
    order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order)
    or [Preview an
    order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder)
    operation call.

    * Up to 50 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create
    an
    order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_Order)
    or [Preview an
    order](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrder)
    operation call.


    If you have an Order that exceeds any limits of the above, Zuora recommends
    you use the following asynchronous API operations:

    * [Create an order
    asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)

    * [Preview an order
    asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)


    Zuora has the following limits on the Orders asynchronous API operations to
    prevent performance degradation:

    * Up to 300 subscriptions are allowed in a single [Create an order
    asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)
    or [Preview an order
    asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)
    operation call.

    * Up to 300 order actions are allowed in a single [Create an order
    asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)
    or [Preview an order
    asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)
    operation call.

    * Up to 300 order actions are allowed on a single subscription in a [Create
    an order
    asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_CreateOrderAsynchronously)
    or [Preview an order
    asynchronously](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/POST_PreviewOrderAsynchronously)
    operation call.


    If you have a need for a large order that exceeds any limits of the above,
    you can request a limit increase for the Orders asynchronous API by
    submitting a request at [Zuora Global
    Support](https://support.zuora.com).        


    **Note:** When you are to suspend a subcription (via the `suspend` order
    action), if in the same "Create an order" call you are to perform other
    subsequent order actions on the supscription to suspend, you must first
    resume the subscription (via a `resume` order action). 


    **Note:** When using this operation to create an account, create a
    subscription, run billing, and collect payment in a single call, if any
    error occurs during the call, such as a payment processing failure and a tax
    engine failure, then all the other steps will be rolled back. This means
    that the invoice will not be generated, the subscription will not be
    created, and the account will not be created.
