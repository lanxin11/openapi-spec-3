  summary: Establish a connection to Zuora REST API
  operationId: POST_Connections
  description: >
    Establishes a connection to the Zuora REST API service based on a valid user
    credentials. 


    **Note:**This is a legacy REST API. Zuora recommends you to use
    [OAuth](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#section/Authentication/OAuth-v2.0)
    for authentication instead. 


    This call authenticates the user and returns an API session cookie that's
    used to authorize subsequent calls to the REST API. The credentials must
    belong to a user account that has permission to access the API service.


    As noted elsewhere, it's strongly recommended that an account used for Zuora
    API activity is never used to log into the Zuora UI.  Once an account is
    used to log into the UI, it may be subject to periodic forced password
    changes, which may eventually lead to authentication failures when using the
    API.
