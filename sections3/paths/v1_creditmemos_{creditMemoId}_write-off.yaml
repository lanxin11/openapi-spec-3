    Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable
    Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist

    Write off a fully unapplied credit memo. When writing off a credit memo, a
    debit memo is automatically created, and then the credit memo to be written
    off is fully applied to the debit memo.


    Note that this operation only supports writing off credit memos that are
    fully unapplied. Credit memos that are not fully unapplied cannot be written
    off by this operation.
