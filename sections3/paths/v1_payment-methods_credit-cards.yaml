  description: >
    You can create a credit card payment method for a customer account or an
    orphan credit card payment method that is not associated with any customer
    account. The orphan payment method must be associated with a customer
    account within 10 days. Otherwise, it will be deleted.


    This API call is CORS Enabled. Use client-side JavaScript to invoke the
    call. 


    **Note**: If you use this operation to create credit card payment methods
    instead of using the [iFrame of Hosted Payment
    Pages](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/LA_Hosted_Payment_Pages/C_Hosted_Payment_Pages/B_Implementing_Hosted_Payment_Pages_on_Your_Website/C_Embed_and_Submit_the_iFrame),
    you are subject to PCI-compliance audit requirements.


    When creating a credit card payment method, it is recommended to enable [the
    support for stored credential
    transactions](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/L_Payment_Methods/Stored_credential_transactions)
    for this payment method. Specify the [required
    fields](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/L_Payment_Methods/Stored_credential_transactions/Configuration_procedures/Create_a_new_payment_method)
    to enable the support.
