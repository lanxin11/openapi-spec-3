  summary: List all files of an invoice
  operationId: GET_InvoiceFiles
  description: >
    Retrieves the information about all PDF files of a specified invoice. 


    Invoice PDF files are returned in reverse chronological order by the value
    of the `versionNumber` field.

    **Note**: This API only retrieves the PDF files that have been generated. If
    the latest PDF file is being generated, it will not be included in the
    response.

    You can use the
    [Query](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTquery)
    action to get the latest PDF file, for example: `"select Body from Invoice
    where Id = '2c93808457d787030157e0324aea5158'"`.

    See [Query an Invoice
    Body](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/API/G_SOAP_API/E1_SOAP_API_Object_Reference/Invoice/Query_an_Invoice_Body_Field)
    for more information.
