    Disconnects an established connection. If you have shared objects from a
    global entity to a target entity, disconnecting the connection will break
    the mapping relationship between these entities and cannot be recovered
    later.


    ## User Access Permission

    You must make the call as an administrator of the target entity or source
    entity.
