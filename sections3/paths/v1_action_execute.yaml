  description: >
    Use the execute call to execute a process to split an invoice into multiple
    invoices. The original invoice must be in draft status. The resulting
    invoices are called split invoices.


    To access this feature, see [Enable Splitting
    Invoices](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/IA_Invoices/Splitting_Invoices#Enable_Splitting_Invoices)
    for steps. 


    To split a draft invoice into multiple split invoices:


    1. Use the create call to create a separate InvoiceSplitItem object for each
    split invoice that you want to create from the original draft invoice.

    2. Use the create call to create a single InvoiceSplit object to collect all
    of the InvoiceSplitItem objects.

    3. Use the execute call to split the draft invoice into multiple split
    invoices.


    You need to create InvoiceSplitItem objects and an InvoiceSplit object
    before you can use the execute call. 


    * Supported objects: InvoiceSplit

    * Asynchronous process: yes
