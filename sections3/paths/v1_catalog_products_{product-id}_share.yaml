  description: >
    **Note:** The Multi-entity feature is in **Limited Availability**. If you
    wish to have access to the feature, submit a request at [Zuora Global
    Support](http://support.zuora.com/).


    Shares a product with a target entity. Zuora synchronizes the shared
    products to the target entity after sharing. For more information about
    product sharing, see [Products Sharing Across
    Entities](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/C_Business_Objects_Sharing_Across_Entities/B_Products_Sharing_Across_Entities).


    Note that:


    - You must finish all the
    [prerequisites](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/Multi-entity/C_Business_Objects_Sharing_Across_Entities/B_Products_Sharing_Across_Entities/Share_Products)
    before sharing products with other entities. 


    - Only source entity administrators have permission to share products with
    other entities. You must make the call as a source entity administrator.


    - Currently, you can only share a product with one entity at a time. An
    error occurs if you try to share a product to more than one entity.
