  summary: Query
  operationId: Action_POSTquery
  description: >
    The query call sends a query expression by specifying the object to query,
    the fields to retrieve from that object, and any filters to determine
    whether a given object should be queried.



    You can use [Zuora Object Query
    Language](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/K_Zuora_Object_Query_Language)
    (ZOQL) to construct those queries, passing them through the `queryString`.



    Once the call is made, the API executes the query against the specified
    object and returns a query response object to your application. Your
    application can then iterate through rows in the query response to retrieve
    information.


    ## Limitations 


    This call has the following limitations:


    * All [ZOQL
    limitations](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Central_Platform/Query/ZOQL#ZOQL_Limitations)
    apply.

    * All ZOQL keywords must be in lower case.

    * The number of records returned is limited to 2000 records.

    * The Invoice Settlement feature is not supported. This feature includes
    Unapplied Payments, Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement.

    * The Orders feature is not supported, which means that the objects listed
    in [Orders Object
    Model](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/BA_Orders_Object_Model)
    are not supported.

    * The default WSDL version for Actions is 79. To query objects or fields
    according to a different WSDL version, set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version`
    header. To find out in which WSDL version a particular object or field was
    introduced, see [Zuora SOAP API Version
    History](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/G_SOAP_API/Zuora_SOAP_API_Version_History).
