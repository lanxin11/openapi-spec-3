  summary: Create sequence sets
  operationId: POST_SequenceSets
  description: >
    Creates sequence sets, allowing distinct numbering sequences for billing
    documents, payments, and refunds. Billing documents include invoices, credit
    memos, and debit memos.


    You can create a maximum of 100 sequence sets in one single request. A
    sequence set comprises a set of custom prefixes and starting numbers that
    are used for billing documents to generate, and payments and refunds to
    create.


    See [Prefix and Numbering Configuration for Billing
    Documents](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/Billing_Settings/Prefix_and_Numbering_Configuration_for_Billing_Documents)
    for more information about limitations.


    **Note**: The Credit and Debit Memos feature is only available if you have
    [Invoice
    Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
    enabled. The Invoice Settlement feature is generally available as of Zuora
    Billing Release 296 (March 2021). This feature includes Unapplied Payments,
    Credit and Debit Memo, and Invoice Item Settlement. If you want to enable
    Invoice Settlement, see [Invoice Settlement Enablement and Checklist
    Guide](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement/Invoice_Settlement_Migration_Checklist_and_Guide)
    for more information.
