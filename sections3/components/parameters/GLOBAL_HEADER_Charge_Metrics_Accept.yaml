description: >
  Expressed as MIME types that the client is able to understand. Using content
  negotiation, the server then selects one of the proposals, uses it and informs
  the client of its choice with the `Content-Type` response header. The possible
  response MIME types are `application/json-seq` compatible with
  http://jsonlines.org/, and `text/csv` compatible with RFC 4180.
  `application/json-seq` is the default response MIME type. If the `Accept`
  header is not sepecified, or set */*, the response body is returned in
  application/json-seq MIME type.
