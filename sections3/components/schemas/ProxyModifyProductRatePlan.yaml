        description: >
          A list of 3-letter currency codes representing active currencies for
          the product rate plan. Use a comma to separate each currency code.


          If the request body contains this field, the value of this field must
          contain the desired list of active currencies. The new list can never
          have more than four differences from the existing list.


          This field cannot be used to modify the status of more than four
          currencies in a single request. For example, in a single request, you
          can only activate four currencies, or deactivate four currencies, or
          activate two and deactivate two. Making more than four changes to
          currencies always requires more than one call.


          When specifying this field in the update request, you must provide the
          full list of active currencies you want, not just incremental changes.
          For each active currency update, provide the following currencies in
          the list:


          Current active currencies + at most four changes (additions or
          deletions)

      Grade:
        description: >
          The grade that is assigned for the product rate plan. The value of
          this field must be a positive integer. The greater the value, the
          higher the grade.


          A product rate plan to be added to a Grading catalog group must have
          one grade. You can specify a grade for a product rate plan in this
          request or update the product rate plan indvidually.


          **Note**: To use this field, you must set the `X-Zuora-WSDL-Version`
          request header to `116` or later. Otherwise, an error occurs.


          **Note**: This field is in the **Early Adopter** phase. We are
          actively soliciting feedback from a small set of early adopters before
          releasing it as generally available. If you want to join this early
