      A string to identify the custom payment method type in the API name of the
      payment method type.


      This field is used along with the `tenantId` field by the system to
      construct and generate the API name of the custom payment method type in
      the following way:


      `<internalName>__c_<tenantId>`


      For example, if `internalName` is `AmazonPay`, and `tenantId` is `12368`,
      the API name of the custom payment method type will be
      `AmazonPay__c_12368`.
