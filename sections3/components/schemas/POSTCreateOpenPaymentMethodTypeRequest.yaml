      If this custom payment method type is specific to one entity only, provide
      the entity UUID in this field. If no entity UUID is provided, the custom
      payment method type is available to the global entity and all the sub
      entities in the tenant.

      this field to be empty.

      Notes:
        - All the following nested metadata must be provided in the request to define a field. 
        - At least one field must be defined in the fields array for a custom payment method type. 
        - Up to 20 fields can be defined in the fields array for a custom payment method type.

      This field must be alphanumeric, starting with a capital letter, excluding
      JSON preserved characters such as  * \ ’ ”. Additionally, '_' or '-' is
      not allowed.

      This field is used along with the `tenantId` field by the system to
      construct and generate the API name of the custom payment method type in
      the following way:


      `<internalName>__c_<tenantId>`


      For example, if `internalName` is `AmazonPay`, and `tenantId` is `12368`,
      the API name of the custom payment method type will be
      `AmazonPay__c_12368`.


      This field cannot be updated after the creation of the custom payment
      method type.
