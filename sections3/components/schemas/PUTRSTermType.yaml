          How you want to distribute the revenue. 



          * Daily Distribution: Distributes revenue evenly across each day
          between the recognitionStart and recognitionEnd dates.

          * Monthly Distribution (Back Load): Back loads the revenue so you
          distribute the monthly amount in the partial month in the end only.

          * Monthly Distribution (Front Load): Front loads the revenue so you
          distribute the monthly amount in the partial month in the beginning
          only.

          * Monthly Distribution (Proration by Days): Splits the revenue amount
          between the two partial months.


          **Note:** To use any of the Monthly Distribution options, you must
          have the "Monthly recognition over time" model enabled in **Settings >
          Finance > Manage Revenue Recognition Models** in the Zuora UI.

      recognitionEnd:
        description: >
          The end date of a recognition period in `yyyy-mm-dd` format. 


          The maximum difference between the `recognitionStart` and
          `recognitionEnd` date fields is equal to 250 multiplied by the length
          of an accounting period.

        type: string
      recognitionStart:
        description: >
          The start date of a recognition period in `yyyy-mm-dd` format.


          If there is a closed accounting period between the `recognitionStart`
          and `recognitionEnd` dates, the revenue that would be placed in the
          closed accounting period is instead placed in the next open accounting
          period.
