          * `submitted` - query submitted to query service for processing

          * `accepted` - query accepted by the query service

          * `in_progress` - query executed by the query service

          * `completed` - query execution completed by the query service

          If the value of this field is `completed`, the `dataFile` field
          contains the location of the query results.


          If the value of this field is `accepted` or `in_progress`, you can use
          [Cancel a data query job](#operation/DELETE_DataQueryJob) to prevent
          Zuora from performing the query. Zuora then sets the status of the
          query job to `cancelled`.
