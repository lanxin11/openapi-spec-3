          If there is already a future-dated Update Product amendment on the
          subscription, the `specificUpdateDate` field will be used instead of
          this field to specify when the Update Product amendment takes effect.

      customerAcceptanceDate:
        description: >
          The date when the customer accepts the contract in yyyy-mm-dd format.


          If this field is not set:


          * If the `serviceActivationDate` field is not set, the value of this
          field is set to be the contract effective date.

          * If the `serviceActivationDate` field is set, the value of this field
          is set to be the service activation date.


          The billing trigger dates must follow this rule:


          contractEffectiveDate <= serviceActivationDate <=
          contractAcceptanceDate

          **Note:** If both `externalCatalogPlanId` and `productRatePlanId` are
          provided. They must point to the same product rate plan. Otherwise,
          the request would fail.

          The date when the new product in the subscription is activated in

          You must specify a Service Activation date if the Customer Acceptance
          date is set. If the Customer Acceptance date is not set, the value of
          the `serviceActivationDate` field defaults to be the Contract
          Effective Date.


          The billing trigger dates must follow this rule:


          contractEffectiveDate <= serviceActivationDate <=
