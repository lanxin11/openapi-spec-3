          To create an orphan payment method that is not associated with any
          customer account, you do not need to specify this field during
          creation. However, you must associate the orphan payment method with a
          customer account within 10 days. Otherwise, this orphan payment method
          will be deleted.

          * `Activate` - Use this value if you are creating the stored
          credential profile after receiving the customer's consent.

            Zuora will create the stored credential profile then send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. If the CIT succeeds, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Active`. If the CIT does not succeed, Zuora will not create a stored credential profile.
            
            If the payment gateway does not support the stored credential transaction framework, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Agreed`.


          * `Persist` - Use this value if the stored credential profile
          represents a stored credential profile in an external system. The
          status of the payment method's stored credential profile will be
          `Active`.
