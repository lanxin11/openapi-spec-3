      The filter rule conditions, written in
      [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/). The scheduled
      event is triggered only if the condition is evaluated as true.

      The rule might contain event context merge fields and data source merge
      fields. Data source merge fields must be from [the base object of the
      event or from the joined objects of the base
      object](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL#Data_Sources_and_Objects).

      Scheduled events with invalid merge fields will fail to evaluate, thus
      will not be triggered. For example, to trigger an invoice due date
      scheduled event to only invoices with an amount over 1000, you would
      define the following condition:


      ```Invoice.Amount > 1000```


      `Invoice.Amount` refers to the `Amount` field of the Zuora object
      `Invoice`.
