          Only the `manyToOne` cardinality can be used when creating
          relationships.  A relationship with `oneToMany` cardinality is created
          implicitly when a `manyToOne` relationship is created.


          A custom object definition can have a maximum of 2 `manyToOne`
          relationships.

                  Specifies whether Zuora validates the values of mapped fields
                  in custom object records.

                  By default, Zuora validates the values of mapped fields
                  in custom object records. For example, if the
                  custom object definition has a field called `AccountId__c`
                  that is mapped to the `Id` field of the `account` object,
                  Zuora verifies that the value of `AccountId__c` is a valid
                  account ID when a custom object record is created.
                  If the value of `AccountId__c` is not a valid account ID,
                  the operation fails.
