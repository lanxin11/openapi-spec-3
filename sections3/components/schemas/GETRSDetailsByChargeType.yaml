      This contains the details of a revenue schedule. If you do not specify the
      `pageSize` variable, the default number of revenue schedules returned per
      invocation is 8, and if there are more than 8 revenue schedules to be
      returned, the `nextPage` field will provide a hyperlink to view the next
      page(s) of revenue events. The order of revenue schedules is descending by
      the `updatedOn` field.
