          Specify `true` to indicate that this is a standalone payment that will
          be created and processed in Zuora through Zuora gateway integration

          `true`:
            - `accountId` or `accountNumber` is required.
            - `amount` is required. 
            - The amount will not be summed up into the account balance and key metrics regardless of the payment currency.

            - Either the applied amount or the unapplied amount of the payment is zero.
            - The standalone payment cannot be applied, unapplied, or transferred.
