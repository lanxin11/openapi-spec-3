      The ID of the customer account associated with this payment method.

      To create an orphan payment method that is not associated with any
      customer account, you do not need to specify this field during creation.
      However, you must associate the orphan payment method with a customer
      account within 10 days. Otherwise, this orphan payment method will be
      deleted.

      **Note:** When `processPayment` is `true`, this field is required.

      If you set this field, Zuora creates a stored credential profile within
      the payment method. This field is only available for CyberSource v2.0

      - `Activate` - Use this value if you are creating the stored credential
      profile after receiving the customer's consent.
          
        Zuora will create the stored credential profile then send a cardholder-initiated transaction (CIT) to the payment gateway to validate the stored credential profile. If the CIT succeeds, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Active`. If the CIT does not succeed, Zuora will not create a stored credential profile.
            
        If the payment gateway does not support the stored credential transaction framework, the status of the stored credential profile will be `Agreed`.

          
      - `Persist` - Use this value if the stored credential profile represents a
      stored credential profile in an external system. The status of the payment
      method's stored credential profile will be `Active`.

      used.


      **Note:** When `processPayment` is `true`, this field is required. When
      `processPayment` is `false`, the default payment gateway of your Zuora
      customer account will be used no matter whether a payment gateway instance
      is specified in the `paymentGateway` field.
