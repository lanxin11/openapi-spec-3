  checksum:
    description: >
      The checksum value of a payment method is used to identify if this payment
      method is the same as another one, or if this payment method is altered to
      another new payment method.


      For example, if you select the credit card number and expiration date as
      the checksum fields for the CreditCard payment method type, when you
      modified the expiration date, Zuora considers this payment method as a
      different payment method compared to the original one.
