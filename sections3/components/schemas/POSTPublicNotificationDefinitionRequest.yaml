      Depending on your environment, you can use one of the following values:

      * `Account.Id`: ID of the primary customer account related to the
      notification. It is also the default value.

      * `ParentAccount.Id`: this option is available only if you have [Customer
      Hierarchy](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Customer_Accounts/A_Customer_Account_Introduction#Customer_Hierarchy)
      enabled for your tenant.

      * `SubscriptionOwnerAccount.Id`: this option is available if the base
      object of the notification is Order Action.


      **Note:** before specifying this field, we recommend that you use [Data
      Source](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Reporting/D_Data_Sources_and_Exports/C_Data_Source_Reference)
      to check the available types of accounts for the current notification.

      You can use the [Query
      Action](https://www.zuora.com/developer/api-reference/#operation/Action_POSTquery)
      to get the communication profile Id. See the following request sample:


      `{
          "queryString": "select Id, ProfileName from CommunicationProfile"
       }`

      If you do not pass the communicationProfileId, notification service will
      be automatically added to the 'Default Profile'.

      For example, if you want to create a notification definition on the
      `OrderActionProcessed` event, you must specify `com.zuora.notification`
      for this field.

          The filter rule conditions, written in
          [JEXL](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jexl/).

          The rule might contain event context merge fields and data source
          merge fields. Data source merge fields must be from [the base object
          of the event or from the joined objects of the base
          object](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/DC_Developers/M_Export_ZOQL#Data_Sources_and_Objects).
          Notifications with invalid merge fields will fail to evaluate, thus
          will not be invoked. For example, to filter an invoice posted
          notification to only invoices with an amount over 1000, you would
          define the following condition:


          ```Invoice.Amount > 1000```


          There are conventions and keywords you need to be aware of. For
          example:


          * `Invoice.Amount` refers to the `Amount` field of the Zuora object
          `Invoice`.


          * Unlike Event Triggers, there is no access to variables with the
          `_old` suffix. Fields with the `_old` suffix are only available on
          Event Trigger conditions.
