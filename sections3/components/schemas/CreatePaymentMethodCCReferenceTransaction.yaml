    description: >
      The masked credit card number, such as:

      ```

      *********1112

      ```


      This field is specific for the CC Reference Transaction payment method. It
      is an optional field that you can use to distinguish different CC
      Reference Transaction payment methods.


      Though there are no special restrictions on the input string, it is highly
      recommended to specify a card number that is masked.
    maxLength: 19

  secondTokenId:
    description: >
      A gateway unique identifier that replaces sensitive payment method data. 


      `secondTokenId` is conditionally required only when `tokenId` is being
      used to represent a gateway customer profile. `secondTokenId` is used in
      the CC Reference Transaction payment method.
    type: string
  tokenId:
    description: >
      A gateway unique identifier that replaces sensitive payment method data or
      represents a gateway's unique customer profile. `tokenId` is required for
      the CC Reference Transaction payment method.


      When `tokenId` is used to represent a customer profile, `secondTokenId` is
      conditionally required for representing the underlying tokenized payment
      method.


      When creating an ACH payment method, if you need to pass in tokenized
      information, use the `mandateId` instead of `tokenId` field.
