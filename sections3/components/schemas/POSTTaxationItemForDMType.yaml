          If you want to use this REST API to create taxation items for a debit
          memo created from an invoice, the taxation items of the invoice must
          be created or imported through the SOAP API call.


          **Note:** 
            - This field is only used if the debit memo is created from an invoice. 
            - If you do not contain this field in the request body, Zuora will automatically set a value for the `sourceTaxItemId` field based on the tax location code, tax jurisdiction, and tax rate.
