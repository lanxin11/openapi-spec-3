      **Note:** As of Zuora Billing Release 306, Zuora has upgraded the
      methodologies for calculating metrics in
      [Orders](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders).
      The new methodologies are reflected in the following Order Delta Metrics
      objects. 

      * [Order Delta
      Mrr](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Delta_Metrics/Order_Delta_Mrr)

      * [Order Delta
      Tcv](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Delta_Metrics/Order_Delta_Tcv)

      * [Order Delta
      Tcb](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Delta_Metrics/Order_Delta_Tcb)


      It is recommended that all customers use the new [Order Delta
      Metrics](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/Order_Delta_Metrics/AA_Overview_of_Order_Delta_Metrics).
      If you are an existing [Order
      Metrics](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders/Key_Metrics_for_Orders)
      customer and want to migrate to Order Delta Metrics, submit a request at
      [Zuora Global Support](https://support.zuora.com/).


      Whereas new customers, and existing customers not currently on [Order
      Metrics](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Subscriptions/Orders/AA_Overview_of_Orders/Key_Metrics_for_Orders),
      will no longer have access to Order Metrics, existing customers currently
      using Order Metrics will continue to be supported.

      also required and not set, a `Pending` order and a `Pending Activation`
      subscription are created instead.
