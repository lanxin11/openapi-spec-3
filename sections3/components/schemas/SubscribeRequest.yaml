      The default behavior is to invoice immediately for all the account's

      collect payment if the account's `AutoPay` flag is true.

            - If only one item is specified, only the items of the spedified type are applied to invoices. For example, if the value is `["CreditMemo"]`, only credit memos are used to apply to invoices.

          If `GenerateInvoice` is true, specifies whether payment should be
          applied when the subscription is created. If the `Account` > `AutoPay`
          flag is true and `GenerateInvoice` is true and `ProcessPayments` is
          true, then the payment is created for the invoice balance and charged.
          The default value is `true`. 


          If a temporary error that Zuora cannot create or submit a payment to
          the gateway is seen, Zuora will automatically retry the action to
          collect the payment. You can contact [Zuora Global
          Support](https://support.zuora.com/) to set the maximum number of
          retries that Zuora can perform. The number can range from 0 to 2 with
          a default value of 0. However, retrying the request can make the API
          call take longer than expected. Zuora does not guarantee the retry
          could be completed within the timeout limit. 


          **Note:** The retry mechanism only supports the case that one single
          subscription is created by the Subscribe action. Also, the retry
          mechanism does not support the preview mode of the Subscribe action.


          **Note:** If you have the [Invoice
          Settlement](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/Billing/Billing_and_Payments/Invoice_Settlement)
          feature enabled, Zuora does not support using this field to collect
