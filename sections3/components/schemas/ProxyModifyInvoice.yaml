          files generated. 


          This field is valid only if you enable the billing document file
          generation feature. To enable this feature, you have to select the
          **Enable the billing document generation** check box after navigating
          to **Billing** > **Manage Billing Document Configuration** through the
          Zuora UI. Otherwise, the request is rejected. 


          For one specific invoice, you can use this field to regenerate PDF
          files for a maximum of 100 times.


          **Note**: If you set this field to `true`, you cannot update any other
          fields in the same update request. Otherwise, you will receive the
          following INVALID_VALUE error:


          "When field RegenerateInvoicePDF is set to true to regenerate the
          invoice PDF file, changes on other fields of the invoice are not
          allowed."
